# Assignment 2, CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Summary

For this assignment, by observing three pairs of images, I was tasked with soley using _Bootstrap_ in HTML to recreate three pages of a *portfolio webite* with the following items:

* A navbar

* A responsive layout

* Responsive images

I also included: 

* A sticky footer

* Functional links to each page in the navbar


## Description

Each page features margins, and makes use of Bootstrap's grid layout in order to generate the position in which objects are seen on each page.

The layout is designed to shift objects so that the website is still legible if the screen size is decreased, which will allow it to be compatible with smart phones.

* The first page, `index.html`, uses:

    * Cards and text-wrapping of an image

    * Random text generated from www.cupcakeipsum.com

* The second page, `portfolio.html`, makes use of:

    * Cards and images

    * Sub-rows and sub-columns to arrange the images and captions

* The third page, `contact.html`, makes use of:

    * A form

    * A button


## Usage

In order to run the application, open the "index.html" file inside the project root directory in the browser window.


## Difficulties and Shortcomings

There were some difficulties with this assignment. For example, seeing as I was using Bootstrap exclusively, I was unable to find out how to change fonts using Bootstrap, or how to make a background image, or objects overlape over one another. I also struggled to make the text wrap perfectly in the "About" page.
